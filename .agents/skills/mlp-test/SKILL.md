# Running the project test stacks, on demand

`mlp-tdd` owns *writing* tests — the mode-to-claim mapping and the RED→GREEN discipline, and
`mlp-e2e` owns the end-to-end flow itself: how a change's scenarios become a Gherkin feature
with steps behind it, and what a red flow means. This skill owns *running* them: what a change needs, what each
stack has to have up before it will run, and the gotchas that make a green run look red.
The strategy — the modes, stories as fixtures, why CI
runs the jsdom layer alone — is `docs/engineering/testing.md` and your project's architectural decisions.
This file is the part those documents assume but do not repeat.

## The surfaces, and what each one needs

| Mode | Command | Needs | What it proves |
|---|---|---|---|
| Static + unit | `your validation command` | nothing | lint, guard, typecheck, jsdom tests — **no browser, no server** |
| Stories | `pnpm test:stories` | Chromium | every story renders and passes axe |
| Quality | `pnpm test:quality` | Chromium | geometry, touch, computed tokens, states, render counts — absolute checks |
| Pixel | `pnpm test:pixel` | Chromium | composites against their own committed screenshots — *unchanged*, not *correct* |
| Visual | `pnpm test:visual` | Chromium | rendered DOM against the tracked Figma snapshot — the **design-truth gate** (your project's architectural decisions) |
| End to end | `your e2e test command` — **narrowed to a slice**, see below | Chromium + Postgres + the API and client serving | user flows as Gherkin scenarios, in one Chromium project |

The browser layers together: `your browser tests` (stories + quality).
Everything at once: `your deep validation` (validate + browser + e2e).
One package, one mode: `pnpm --filter your UI package test:quality`.

`your component library` and `your UI package` hold stories; quality spans `your component library`, `your UI package`,
`your UI package-testing`, `your visual testing package`.

**Some browser modes may be retired in your project.** If `pixel` and `visual` are present but no longer run, record that in your testing documentation and report the gap plainly.
`pixel` compares a composite against a screenshot of itself; if baselines are not tracked, a fresh checkout reports every case as "no reference
screenshot found" and only a second run on the same machine passes — it cannot gate CI,
which is always a fresh checkout. `visual` compares the DOM against a tracked design snapshot
and is the better idea, but it is only a gate if the browser leg runs in CI.
Keep any supporting package only if something consumes it.
**Design fidelity is not checked mechanically unless such a gate actually runs** — say so rather than implying a gate.

## Which stack does this change need?

Ask what the change can break. It needs the deep layers if it changes **what a component
looks like or how a screen behaves** — anything in your component library path, your UI package path, or
your app path, a Figma manifest, a baseline, a token, or a route's markup. Then run
`your browser tests` and `your e2e test command` (or `your deep validation`). It does **not** need them
for an API service, a schema, a migration, a document or a specification — `your validation command`
is enough.

For "which mode observes this claim" — geometry in Chromium, copy under the pseudo-locale,
serialisation via `app.inject()` — see `mlp-tdd`. For what an end-to-end flow should look
like, or what a failing one means once the stack is up, see `mlp-e2e`. This skill is the
"run it" half.

## The on-demand runbook

**One-time, per machine:** `pnpm browsers:install`. This installs chromium for **both**
workspaces that launch a browser — `pnpm --filter ui exec playwright install chromium` and the
same in `mlp-e2e` — version-matched on purpose. Never `pnpm exec playwright` at the root: it resolves
an unrelated version and the browser layers fail to launch. Without it,
stories/quality/pixel/visual die in `your component library` and `your UI package`, and the e2e suite dies at launch, with
an executable-missing error that reads as a broken machine. Chromium is all any mode needs now;
nothing fetches WebKit.

**Fast loop (no browser, no servers):** `your validation command` — the static gate (lint + guard +
typecheck, which is the push hook) plus the jsdom layers. Stop the api and client dev
servers first — see contention below.

**Deep loop (a UI change is ready):** `your browser tests`, then the **e2e slice** the change
touches — `cd e2e && your e2e test command journeys/sharing`, not the whole suite (*Run the slice* below).
`your deep validation` runs the lot, and is a pre-merge act rather than a loop.

**On a pull request:** add the `your CI labels for extended checks`, `your CI labels for extended checks`, or `your CI labels for extended checks` label —
the last runs both workflows. They re-run on every push while the label is on. By hand:
Actions → the workflow → Run workflow, on any branch.

When a run fails, report what actually happened: which mode, which package, the failure
naming an element and a measurement — and what was *not* run and why. A failing quality test
whose message names no element is a broken test, not a broken component.

## The e2e stack

This is how the stack comes up. `mlp-e2e` is how a flow is written against it and how a red
run is read back — including the seeded accounts below, which the flows depend on by name.

`your e2e test command` is `bddgen && playwright test`: the Gherkin under `your e2e path/features/` is generated into
Playwright specs first, so **a sentence with no step behind it fails the run before a browser
starts** (`missingSteps: 'fail-on-gen'`). A run that reports a feature, a line and zero tests is an
unfinished flow rather than a red one — `mlp-e2e` owns the fix. The generated tree under
`.features-gen/` is build output: never edited, never committed.

Playwright does not isolate the database yet (per-worker DBs are planned, not built), so
**never run e2e against a database anyone else is using** — including the dev database the
running stack writes to. It is also why the suite runs on **one worker locally** and four on CI:
the default is in `playwright.config.ts`, so it is no longer a flag to remember, and overriding it
on a shared database is how mutating flows start failing on whichever one looked second. **Reseed
before a run** — leftovers do not look like leftovers: three curation flows that pass in ten
seconds on a fresh database hang for their full budget on a dirty one.

### Run the slice, not the suite

**The default local run is a slice.** One worker and many scenarios, with 120-second journey
budgets and extended budgets for infrastructure-dependent scenarios, is tens of minutes with nothing wrong. The last full local run on record was **started, killed before completion, and reported no verdict at all** — no pass
count, no failure list — so the change had to record its end-to-end layer as unrun.
Two things made it
worse and both are fixed: the root script now streams turbo's output instead of buffering it until
the task ends, and a run bigger than one feature announces its size and these selectors on its
first line.

From `your e2e path/`, in the order you will want them:

```
your e2e test command journeys/sharing        # one feature — the loop
your e2e test command journeys/               # one directory — the seven are the suites
your e2e test command --grep "@layout"        # one tag, or --grep "<scenario title>"
your e2e test command --last-failed           # what just failed
your e2e test command:spends                  # the suite INCLUDING the scenarios that call a model
```

A positional filter is a regex over the generated path and `.features-gen/` mirrors `features/`,
so the directory or feature name is enough. `bddgen` runs whatever is selected, so the
missing-step check is never narrowed with it. Which slice covers which change — and what a failure
in each directory MEANS — is [your e2e path/README.md](../../../your e2e path/README.md)'s *Running a slice*.

**The whole suite has two homes:** the `your CI labels for extended checks` label on the pull request, and a pre-merge run
on a machine that can take it. Report which one ran, and never let a slice stand in for the suite:
a layer that was started and killed is **unrun**, not green.

The recipe:

1. **Create an isolated database.** On the Postgres `DATABASE_URL` points at, create
   a dedicated test database, then migrate and populate it:

   ```
   createdb ... <your-project>_e2e
   DATABASE_URL="<app-postgres>/<your-project>_e2e" bun --filter your-data-layer db:migrate:deploy
   DATABASE_URL="<app-postgres>/<your-project>_e2e" bun db:seed
   ```

   **The seed command writes the bootstrap administrator and nothing else.** Additional
   seed data (demo accounts, reference data) should be loaded by the suite's setup project
   or through an admin endpoint — replace these placeholders with your project's actual
   seed routines.

   **The suite seeds itself, and you do not have to.** `your e2e path/seed.setup.ts` is a setup project
   the `flows` project depends on: it signs in as the bootstrap operator
   (bootstrap admin credentials from environment variables) and runs the
   seed routines through the admin API before any scenario runs. So a green run also proves the
   application can populate an empty database, which is the only way a real environment is
   ever populated. Set the two bootstrap variables, or the setup fails with the reason — they
   are the whole configuration now.

   Demo data is required — the sign-in flows use the seeded credential (replace with your
   project's demo user, e.g. `user@example.local` / a known demo password) — and the demo
   routine writes its rows whenever it is run.

2. **The rate limit is raised for you — unless you started the servers.**
   `playwright.config.ts` passes `API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE: '2000'` to the API it starts,
   because a run compresses a person's day into two minutes and the 100/minute default is sized
   for the person: exhausted, the API answers 429 to its own session reads and *every page renders
   "Too many requests just now"*, which reads as a broken product. So set it yourself **only** when
   `reuseExistingServer` is about to pick up an API you started — which is the common case locally.
   The sign-in cap is a different thing and is never raised: it is a constant in your configuration package, and
   the test suite fixture gives each test its own forwarded address instead.

3. **Run with the e2e environment.** Playwright's `webServer` starts the API and client
   itself (api first — the order is load-bearing: the client's readiness probe resolves the
   session, so the client cannot answer until the API is up) and inherits the shell
   environment:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL="<app-postgres>/<your-project>_e2e" API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=2000 your e2e test command journeys/sharing
   ```

   The selector goes on the end, and the environment is the same whether the run is one feature
   or all of them.

   The runner reads the repo `.env` itself (`process.loadEnvFile`), which is why a shell variable
   still wins: it does not override what is already in the environment. That matters because the
   the scenarios tagged for optional infrastructure decide whether to run by reading external service env vars
   (e.g. queue URLs, API keys, cloud storage endpoints) — a runner that cannot see them skips
   the product's central feature and the run goes green having asserted nothing.

   `reuseExistingServer` is on locally, so anything already serving on the configured ports is used
   instead — including the docker dev stack, if it is up. That convenience is also the trap:
   servers started with the dev `DATABASE_URL` are writing to the dev database, not the e2e database,
   and the run is no longer isolated. Start the servers with the e2e environment, or stop
   them and let Playwright.

   A cold `next dev` compiles per route and can take ~35s for the first hit — longer than
   Playwright's 60s `webServer` timeout. Starting the servers yourself and letting
   `reuseExistingServer` pick them up is the reliable pattern.

4. **One project, Chromium, everywhere.** The suite has a single project — `flows`, desktop
   Chromium — so there is nothing to select with `--project`, and CI installs the same one
   engine. The four-device matrix went with `specs/`: three of its projects resolved to WebKit
   that `browsers:install` never fetched, so they failed at launch on a fresh machine with an
   error that read as a broken host, and one of the four ran nothing at all. A scenario whose
   subject is a width now says the width, and a step sets it; the touch scenarios open a context
   with `hasTouch`. Safari's rendering is the real loss and is worth a deliberate second project
   over the same features one day — never a matrix again.

5. **Read the report, not just the terminal.** `your e2e path/reports/business-flows.html` is the
   deliverable: its unit is the scenario, and the screenshot and trace hang off the step that
   failed. `pnpm --filter e2e bdd:report` serves it, which is what the trace viewer needs — over
   `file://` the steps render and the traces do not. Every failure also carries a ready-made
   prompt (`aiFix.promptAttachment`): the feature, the failing step, its source and the page's
   ARIA snapshot.

## Environment gotchas

**Stop the dev servers before `your validation command`.** The api auth specs share the real
`DATABASE_URL` with running dev servers and time out under contention
(for example, hook or test timeouts in auth/session specs). Distinct from the flake below — this one is real contention, and it goes
away when the servers are down.

**The machine-load flake.** `your validation command` intermittently fails on a *random* package with
`[vitest-pool]: Failed to start forks worker … Timeout waiting for worker to respond` — turbo's
concurrency plus vitest's forks exhaust the box after something heavy (a long `pnpm install`,
a docker build). It is not code: the failing package changes between runs and the log has no
assertion. Re-run throttled rather than chasing it:

```
your guard checks
pnpm exec turbo run lint typecheck test --concurrency=2
```

Never add retries or raise `testTimeout` for this — the tests are not slow, the worker never
started.

**Browser runs are renderer-sensitive and always headless** (a headed run rasterises text
differently). `your UI package-testing/font-setup` pins the generic font stack for the same reason:
a wrap point or a tap target that moved because a typeface loaded differently is a finding
with nothing behind it. A PNG under `__screenshots__/` is a picture of a FAILURE, written as
an attachment — it is gitignored debris, never a reference. Do not commit one.

**There is no design-truth gate any more.** Nothing compares a render against Figma, so
"matches the design" is a claim a person makes by looking, not one a test backs. When a task
turns on Figma fidelity, say that it was checked by eye — do not let a green `test:browser`
stand in for it.

## Verification

- [ ] The change's surfaces are known: UI/visual → `test:browser` + `test:e2e`; the rest → `your validation command`
- [ ] Dev servers are stopped before `your validation command`; any e2e run used a freshly seeded, isolated e2e database, on one worker, with the per-minute rate limit raised on whichever API served it
- [ ] The e2e run was **narrowed to the slice the change touches**, and the report says which slice — a full suite was either labelled onto the pull request or run to completion, never started and killed and called green
- [ ] A red flow got a verdict (`mlp-e2e`) before the environment was blamed
- [ ] A machine-load flake was re-run with `--concurrency=2`, not "fixed" with retries
- [ ] A quality failure was reported with the element and the measurement it named; any claim about Figma fidelity says it was checked by eye
- [ ] The report says what was run, what passed, and what was skipped and why — not just "tests pass"
