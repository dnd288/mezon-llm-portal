# The optimization loop

**The defining constraint: every change you keep is justified by a number, and the observable answer
never changes.** A faster wrong answer is not an optimisation, it is a regression that happened to
run quickly. Everything below exists to keep those two facts checkable.

This is the mirror image of `mlp-refactor`. There, the shape changes and behaviour is pinned still.
Here, runtime behaviour — time, memory, bytes, cost — changes on purpose, and *correctness* is the
thing pinned still. The loop is what stops "optimising" from meaning "changing things until it feels
snappier".

## First: should you optimise at all?

Most of the time the answer is no, and saying so is the highest-value move in this skill.

- **Is there a number that is actually missed?** An SLO, a budget, a benchmark, a user-visible
 stall. No target means no optimisation — `mlp-simplicity` owns the case where the honest answer is
 "this is fast enough and the tuning would only add complexity". Premature optimisation is the
 default mistake, not a rare one.
- **Do you know where the time goes?** If not, you are about to optimise a guess. Profile first
 (next section). The bottleneck is almost never where it feels like it is.
- **Is the shape wrong?** If the hot path is tangled enough that you cannot change one variable
 cleanly, the honest sequence is `mlp-refactor` first (behaviour pinned), then optimise. Not both at
 once — you will not be able to attribute the delta.

## The loop

**BASELINE → CHANGE → MEASURE → KEEP-OR-REVERT.** Each step feeds the next; skipping BASELINE or
MEASURE turns the whole thing back into guessing.

### 1. BASELINE — measure before you touch anything

Run `bun run test` (or the profiler) under conditions you can reproduce, and **write the
number down** along with the target you are trying to hit. This is what MEASURE compares against, and
"it felt faster" is not a number. Record the noise too — run it more than once so you know what a
real improvement has to beat.

**Profile before you guess.** The hot path is measured, not assumed. A day spent optimising the 2%
is a day the 80% did not move.

### 2. CHANGE — one variable at a time

One optimisation per iteration. Two changes at once and MEASURE cannot tell you which one paid — so
a kept change may be carrying a silent regression alongside a real win.

**Pin correctness before it moves.** The test suite is green before the change and green after it —
`bun run validate`, plus the specific tests that observe the behaviour you are speeding up
(`mlp-tdd`/`mlp-test` own which mode observes which claim). If you cannot prove the answer is unchanged, you
are not optimising, you are rewriting.

### 3. MEASURE — the same benchmark, the same way

Re-run the identical benchmark under identical conditions and compare to BASELINE. Different input,
different machine, or a warm cache where BASELINE was cold makes the comparison meaningless.

### 4. KEEP-OR-REVERT — the number decides, not the effort

Keep the change **only if all three hold**: the target metric improved beyond the noise you
measured, correctness held, and nothing else you care about regressed (a latency win that doubles
memory is a trade to make on purpose, not by accident). Otherwise **revert it** — a change that
bought no measured improvement bought only complexity, and keeping it because it "should be faster"
is how a codebase fills with cargo-cult tuning.

**Record the reverts.** A one-line note of what was tried and the number it did (or did not) move
saves the next person from re-trying it. `mlp-problem-solving`'s dev note is a good shape for this when
the attempt was substantial.

## When NOT to optimise

- **No target.** Fast enough is done. See `mlp-simplicity`.
- **The bottleneck is elsewhere.** You profiled the wrong layer. Measure, then move.
- **The gain costs more than it returns.** An unreadable micro-optimisation for a 1% win on a path
 nobody waits on is a net loss — the bill is paid by every future reader.
- **The shape is about to change.** Tuning code that a pending feature will replace spends the
 budget twice.

## Before you finish

- [ ] A target number existed before the work started
- [ ] BASELINE and after numbers are both stated, from the same benchmark run the same way
- [ ] Correctness is green — the observable answer did not change
- [ ] One variable per kept change, so each delta is attributable
- [ ] Every change that did not beat the noise was reverted, not kept "just in case"
- [ ] Any regression traded away (memory for speed, etc.) was a deliberate, stated trade
