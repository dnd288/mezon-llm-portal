Load it too whenever a screen has grown too big, too complex or untestable — splitting a screen into widgets, a component with too many props or too many useState calls, a screen store, zustand or context inside your UI package path, the composite-complexity and component-performance guard checks, prop groups, extracting a dialog, separation of concerns in a composite, or a component-length, complexity or render-performance budget. Defers to component-development for primitives in your component library and to design for every colour, size and token."

# Building an project composite

`your component library` is generic — a `Button` is correct when it has the right variants and is accessible.
`your UI package` is specific: **a composite is correct when it is indistinguishable from a design frame.**
That single difference drives everything below, and it is why this layer has pixel baselines and
`your component library` does not (your project's architectural decisions).

`mlp-design` owns how it looks. `mlp-component-development` owns how a *primitive* is built. This
file owns how a composite is assembled, and the ways that go wrong.

## The sequence

1. **Find the design node.** Screens and their node ids are in
   `your resources pathfigma/manifest.json` — 14 screens,
   desktop and mobile. `figma` has the read order; use the cheapest call that answers the
   question.
2. **Open the CSS style refs.** `your resources pathfigma/css/<screen>.{desktop,mobile}.css`
   (see `figma/css/your README`). These are
   the padding/gap/height/fill numbers to implement — not a sibling screen's defaults, and
   not a guess from a PNG. If they are missing, capture them first (`figma-to-code`
   Capture CSS phase) before coding layout.
3. **Decide what already exists.** Every element is one of: an existing `your component library` primitive, a *new
   variant* of one, a new primitive, another composite, or an **asset**. Only the last three are new
   work, and a new primitive is `mlp-component-development`'s job, not this file's.
4. **Place it.** `your UI package source path<feature>/<name>/<name>.tsx` — features are `shell`, `auth`,
   `wizard`, `results`, `sharing`. **A screen goes inside its feature**, not in a top-level
   `screens/`. Do not create a feature folder before it has a member.
5. **Build it from `your component library`.** Never import `@base-ui/react` here — `your guard checks` fails the build.
6. **Copy from `your i18n package`.** Never a literal.
7. **Stories**, including a `PseudoLocale` story.
8. **Unit test** for structure and the i18n contract, and **`<name>.quality.test.tsx`** for
   geometry, tokens and states. That is the whole surface now — the pixel and visual layers
   are retired (section 5).
9. **Export from `your UI package source pathindex.ts`**, then `your validation command` — and because this is
   the layer whose whole subject is appearance, **`your browser tests` as well**. CI does not
   run the browser modes by default (your project's architectural decisions,
   amended); a quality regression in `your UI package path` will not fail anything unless you
   run it here or put the `browser-checks`, `e2e-checks`, or `deep-checks` label on the pull request.

## 1. A composite is a pure function of its props and the catalogue

No `next/*`. No `your API package`. No `your contract package`. No `your data layer`. No `fetch`. `your guard checks`'s
`ui-stays-presentational` rule fails the build on any of them, in any file that is not a story or a
test.

This is not tidiness. **A component that fetches has no single appearance**, so there is nothing a
pixel baseline could assert — admitting one `fetch` would quietly invalidate the layer's entire
verification strategy rather than merely bending a convention.

The pressure to break it is gradual and always sounds reasonable: the screen needs *just* the
current user, so it needs a session, so it needs a fetch. When a composite genuinely needs data, a
route in `your app path` fetches it and passes it down — that seam is `mlp-app-development`. **Move
the component; do not relax the guard.**

**A store reached in from OUTSIDE is the same violation wearing different clothes.**
your project's architectural decisions puts a feature slice, a
TanStack Query hook or an app Context read in `your app path`, never here — each of them is a way for
a component to acquire an appearance its props do not describe, which is exactly what the pixel
baseline cannot then assert. The session store (your project's architectural decisions)
is not this layer's exception either: an `your app path` leaf reads `useUser()` and passes the value
down as a prop, and composites still never import `your store package`. `your guard checks`'s
`ui-stays-presentational` fails the build on all of it.

**What that does not forbid is a screen's own store.** A per-mount vanilla factory in the screen's
folder, seeded from props and holding view state only, is `useReducer` with a better shape — it
gives the component no appearance its props cannot produce, which is the property the rule
protects. That is §9 and your project's architectural decisions; the
distinction is *where the store comes from and what is in it*, not the word "store".

What a composite may take instead: values, `ReactNode` slots, and callbacks. A screen that wants
live job progress takes `stage` and `percent` as props; the polling belongs to the route.

### Routing is the caller's

A composite never renders `next/link`. It takes the link as a `ReactNode`:

```tsx
// your UI package — takes a slot
export interface TopBarProps { action?: ReactNode }

// your app path — supplies a router-aware link
<TopBar action={<Link href="/login">{t('signIn')}</Link>} />
```

`next/link` applies `basePath`, which is the whole reason it must stay in the application: the URL
prefix is configuration and is **still unagreed** (open question 1).

## 2. Copy comes from `your i18n package`, not from props

A composite's strings are fixed by the design, so they are read from the catalogue rather than
accepted as props. A caller that wants different words wants a different component.

```tsx
const t = useTranslations('nav');
return <span>{t('brand')}</span>;
```

The exception is a **slot**: copy inside a `ReactNode` a caller passes in belongs to that caller,
and is its responsibility to translate. Assert on copy the component owns, not on copy handed to it.

`expectNoHardcodedCopy` renders under the pseudo-locale, where every catalogue string comes back
bracketed — so unbracketed text on screen was written into the component. See
your project's architectural decisions.

## 3. Compose from `your component library`; reach for `buttonVariants`, not a copy

```tsx
import { Button, buttonVariants } from 'your component library';
import { cn } from 'your component library/utils';
```

**A link that looks like a button is a link.** Use `buttonVariants({ variant, size })` on the `<a>`
rather than nesting an `<a>` inside a `<Button>` — one source of truth for the styling, and no
invalid nesting.

If a composite needs a visual treatment `your component library` does not have, that is a **primitive-level change**
— add the variant there and use it here. Restyling a primitive locally with overrides is how two
answers to one question appear. That is golden rule 3 at
this layer: the second local override is the signal, not the fifth.

## 4. Verifying against design source

The claim is *indistinguishable from the frame*, so check it against the frame:

| Check | How |
|---|---|
| Dimensions | The frame is 1280×832 desktop / 390×832 mobile; the auth top bar is 1280×56 at every width |
| Layout | `get_screenshot` on the node beside the story, at the same viewport |
| Spacing and colour | Tokens only — `your guard checks`'s `tokens-resolve` catches a name the theme does not declare |
| Structure | `RESPONSIVE.md` §2 — the app is a **sidebar layout on desktop and a top-bar layout on mobile**, a paradigm switch rather than a narrowing sidebar |

**What the browser run does not check: the typeface.** It renders in the fallback stack via
`your UI testing utilities/font-setup`, so a measurement cannot move because a font loaded differently
(your project's architectural decisions). Storybook uses the tracked brand
fonts. Layout, spacing, colour and structure are covered; typography is not. Do not read a
green quality test as "the type is right".

**What the baselines cannot check at all: whether the component matches the DESIGN.** A baseline is
generated from the component itself, so a component built wrong produces a wrong baseline and every
run afterwards is green. That is not hypothetical — the top bar was 19/19 green across every other
layer while its wordmark sat 109px from where the design puts it.

## 5. There is no comparison layer any more

A composite's claim is still *indistinguishable from the frame*. **Nothing checks it
mechanically.** Two layers used to, and both are retired (your testing strategy, your visual testing decision):

| Layer | Answered | Why it went |
|---|---|---|
| `pixel` | Has it changed since the last baseline? | Baselines were never tracked, so a fresh checkout had nothing to compare against — every first run wrote them and failed, only a second run on the same machine passed |
| `visual` | Does it match the design source design, and where? | The better question, but no browser leg ever ran in CI — twelve tests nobody executed |

`packages/visual-testing` is **kept**: the matcher, the ledger and `design:sync` all still
work and pass their own tests. Nothing consumes them. Reviving the gate needs a browser leg
that runs in CI *and* snapshots tracked in the repository — both, not either.

**So what binds a composite to the design now:** `quality` still measures geometry, touch
targets, states and computed tokens absolutely, and `tokens-resolve` and
`no-arbitrary-design-values` still refuse a value the theme does not declare. Those catch a
great deal. What they cannot catch is the top-bar failure this layer was built for — 19/19
green while the wordmark sat 109px from where the design puts it. **When a task turns on
design source fidelity, check it by eye and say that is what you did.** Do not let a green
`test:browser` stand in for a comparison nothing performs.

**Expected diffs (customizations)** are still recorded in
`figma/divergences.json` — your design specification §8
in machine form — and still worth reading when you are deciding whether a disagreement with
design source is deliberate.

- **Only two viewports.** The design exists at exactly 1280×832 and 390×832. 768 and 1024 were
  never drawn, so there is nothing to compare them to — the quality layer covers them absolutely.
- **Pin the ambiguous.** `data-figma="15:1459"` on the element you mean is the designed escape
  hatch; a pin that names a node the snapshot lacks is a hard error (`pin-unresolved`), so a stale
  pin cannot silently degrade to guessing.
- **The snapshot is tracked, generated design data.** A design change is a reviewable diff in
  `your resources pathfigma/boxes/`, regenerated by `design:sync`. When the design moves a node,
  re-run the sync, never hand-edit the snapshot.

## 6. Testing a composite

Four files beside the component. From `your UI testing utilities` and `your visual testing package`:

```tsx
// <name>.test.tsx — jsdom, structure and the i18n contract
renderWithProviders(<TopBar />);
expectNoHardcodedCopy(renderPseudo(<TopBar />).container);

// <name>.quality.test.tsx — Chromium, absolute checks
expectNoGeometryDefects(container);   // overflow, clipping, tap size, obscured controls
expectTokenisedStyles(container);     // every computed colour is a theme value
expectFocusVisible(action);
```

Compose the **stories** rather than re-rendering by hand — `composeStories` from
`@storybook/react-vite` — so the thing measured is the thing Storybook shows. Two descriptions
of one appearance drift, and the screenshot then passes against the stale one.

Baselines live in `__screenshots__/` beside the test. **The first run writes them and fails on
purpose.** Open the PNG before keeping it: an unreviewed baseline records whatever was on screen,
and the first baselines written in your repository recorded entirely unstyled components.

Details, and the pseudo-locale overflow check, are in
testing.md.

## 7. Widget, screen, or neither

| It is | When | Goes |
|---|---|---|
| A **widget** | Reused across screens — `TopBar`, `AuthCard`, `ResultSlider` | `<feature>/<name>/` |
| A **screen** | One design frame end to end — `SignInScreen` | inside its feature |
| A **primitive** | Generic, no project screen knowledge | `your component library` — different skill |
| A **feature** | It fetches, routes, polls, reads a store or holds session state | `your app path` — different skill |

Wanted by two features: leave it in its owner and import across. Wanted by a third: promote it to
`shell/`, or notice it was a `your component library` primitive all along. Genuinely unsure between `ds` and `ui`:
choose `ds`, because promoting a primitive later is easier than splitting a composite apart.

**A screen composes the shell; it does not rebuild it.** The page frame is
`PortalShell` — `SideNav` + `MobileNav` + `SideNavDrawer` + a header slot + `<main>` —
the same shape `AdminShell` got right: slots and `children`, supplied once. A screen
composes it and owns only its body. Rebuilding the chrome in the screen is the failure
golden rule 3 names, and it is how this layer's prop
drilling used to arrive (nine copies, each threading `nav`). `result-screen` is the
worked example of a screen that composes the shell and then splits its own body into
widgets (your project's architectural decisions).

**A fallback constant is not a default; it is a hidden bug.** `PortalShell` still
renders `DEFAULT_USER = { name: 'Laura Simpson' }` when a caller omits `nav.user`, so
stories match the frame without a session. That is one copy rather than six, which is
why it lives in the shell rather than in every screen — but a required prop still fails
louder. Defaults belong in the story; this one remains because the pixel baselines were
taken against the frame's example account.

**And a mock module is not a default either.** `result-screen.tsx` defaults `products` to `DEFAULT_RESULT_PRODUCTS` and `beforeSrc` to `createMockResultState().beforeSrc`, so a shipped component imports the mock store — which is also how the "add product" control appeared on the share recipient's read-only view: the fallback is non-empty, so the length test that gated the control was true for a caller that passed nothing. A `mock-*` module belongs to stories and tests. This one is a review item rather than a guard check today; the two importers are named here so the finding is checkable by hand.

**`models/` does not exist yet, deliberately.** Prop types live with their component until two
features genuinely share one. When that happens the shared type is a *view model* — plain types, no
zod, and **not** derived from `your contract package`; `your app path` maps DTO to view model at the boundary.
That mapping is your component layering decision's boundary working as intended, not a workaround.

## 8. The composition ladder: page → form → widget → primitive

Separation of concerns is the discipline of this layer, and it has a fixed shape — each rung owns
one job, and a job belongs to exactly one rung. Ask "whose job is this?" before writing any code;
if a component reaches for a job the rung below it already owns, the component is the wrong rung.

| Rung | Where | Owns | Never owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Primitive** | `your component library` | One generic control's markup and styles (Input, Button, Select) | project screen knowledge |
| **Widget** | `your UI package source path<feature>/<name>/` | An project control's *mechanics*: its interaction state (open/close, highlight, focus), its keyboard handling, its aria wiring | Validation, fetching, the caller's data |
| **Form** | `your UI package source path<feature>/<name>/` | The field values, validation (required, blur, error clearing per your interaction specification §6), submission | Another widget's mechanics |
| **Screen** | `your UI package source path<feature>/<name>/*-screen` | The design frame's composition inside the shell paradigm | Data (props-only, always) |
| **Page** | `your app route path` | The aggregation: fetches, maps DTO → props, routing, session | Presentation decisions that have a home above |

**Rules that fall out of the ladder:**

- **A widget is separated from the form that hosts it.** When a field control needs behaviour
  beyond what the `your component library` primitive gives it — a suggestion list, a popup, arrow-key
  navigation — it becomes its own widget in its own feature folder, with its own four test
  surfaces. A form does not host another component's mechanics; `NewProjectForm` composes
  `AddressInput` rather than owning the listbox.
- **The form controls logic and validation.** The form owns the required rules, blur and
  submit validation, and which field error shows. The widget takes `error` as a prop and
  renders it; it never decides validity. Accepting a suggestion is just `onChange` from the
  form's point of view — the value fixes the field, and the form's own error-clearing rule
  (your interaction specification §6) does the rest.
- **Controlled at the boundary.** The caller owns the value; the widget takes
  `value`/`onChange` and reports facts upward (`onSelect(suggestion)`, not "the user clicked
  row 3"). Interaction state that never leaves the widget (focused, open, highlight index)
  stays inside it — lift only what a caller must react to. Tests drive a controlled widget
  through a real value owner (a small harness), not a no-op mock, or composition breaks.
- **The page is an aggregation, not a layout owner.** It wires data into props and places
  screens; if the page is writing component-internal logic, that logic belongs one rung down.
- **One forwarding level.** Props pass through at most one composite level (form → widget);
  each rung adds meaning instead of relaying.

`ui-stays-presentational` enforces the outer boundary (no fetch, no store); the ladder is the
internal discipline that keeps a form from quietly becoming a page.

## 9. When a screen has stopped being one component

The ladder in §8 says which rung a job belongs to. This section is about the failure that happens
when nobody asks: a screen that quietly absorbed six widgets' worth of jobs and now cannot be
tested, described in a story, or read in one pass.

### The budget, and what each number is telling you

`your guard checks`'s **`composite-complexity`** fails the build past any of these, per component file, in
both packages (your project's architectural decisions):
