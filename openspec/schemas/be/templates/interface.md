# Interface

## Contract shapes this change adds or changes

<!-- The zod schemas landing in the shared contract package: request bodies, response shapes, and
     the enums they reference. The response schema is a security control, not a type
     — name what it deliberately withholds. -->

## What consumes them

<!-- The ui change whose prop types these must satisfy, and the fe change that will
     map between the two. If nothing consumes this yet, say so: a contract with no
     consumer is a guess about a screen nobody has drawn. -->

## Store and state

<!-- Almost always "none — this change writes no client state". Said explicitly
     because a be change that needs one is a boundary violation worth catching here
     rather than at review. -->
